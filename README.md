I am working on a project called 'Pressure Spike' for transitioning service members and veterans interested in entering the fluid power industry. The goal is to provide information on certifications and preparation, books, links, and various topics that serve as core knowledge for professionals in the industry.

Another project that I am working on is learning how to integrate Python with electro-hydraulic and electro-pneumatic application engineering. Whether it be using Matplotlib to plot hydraulic horsepower curves and hysteresis graphs, creating motor-torque charts with Pandas or building a functional library to be used in systems simulators,  Python has many potential use cases in my field. Eventually, I would like to write Python tutorials specifically for fluid power professionals.
